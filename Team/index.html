Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.
                Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.
                Just let these leaves jump off the brush We'll make some happy little bushes here. Here's something that's fun. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Play with the angles.
                It's all a game of angles. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
