            <p class = "p1">Sir Fleming College (Fleming College) is a college based out of Ontario. It was founded in Peterborough, Ontario in 1967 by Sir Sanford Fleming. Sir Sanford Fleming was an engineer and innovator with many life accomplishments. He was the first to survey and draw plans for the Pacific-Atlantic rail line, he invented the Universal Standard Time, he designed Canada’s first postage stamp, he was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Institute, and many more. Today, the college has campuses in Peterborough, Lindsay (Frost Campus),  and Haliburton. Fleming college has over one-hundred programs and is most known for its excellence in environmental, natural, and social sciences. Each year the college hosts an open house to showcase the programs they offer with booths set up throughout the main buildings. This project demonstrates the use of a range of different web solutions for campus navigation, and more specifically for the college’s annual open house at Frost Campus.

        <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
        <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <h3>Ideal: </h3>
            <p class = "p1"> Visitors to the college campus should be able to navigate from one room to another using a web based solution. 
                Additionally, the school is interested in the capability of having staff collecting data, and tracking staff location.
            </p>
            <h3>Reality: </h3>
            <p class = "p1"> It is unknown what technology is available to navigate on a room-to-room level, collect data, or track staff. No solution is currently in place 
            </p>
            <h3>Consequences: </h3> 
            <p class = "p1"> Some technologies require extensive licenses, or may not be suited to this solution, keeping 
                campus navigation difficult. Sharing updates on locations without spatial data leads to complications and misunderstanding.  
                Additionally, not knowing the location of staff can complicate emergencies.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposal: </h3>
            <p class = "p1"> Investigate appropriate GIS solutions that will allow for public navigation of the campus (indoor wayfinding), data collection, 
                and tracking for specific user types,using a mobile phone. An evaluation of advantages and disadvantages for relevant technology will be presented 
                as well as a rapid prototype implemented for the ideal solution.
            </p>

        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1">To fulfill our team’s proposal, several technologies were investigated and tested to create solutions for Fleming College Frost Campus. 
            As navigation solutions were our original focus, most of the solutions are specific to that goal; ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS StoryMaps, and various JavaScript 
           solutions were used to create navigation applications. ArcGIS Field Maps was used to meet all the clients’ goals, navigation, data collection, and location tracking. 
            After investigation these technologies, Experience Builder was selected as our final solution for navigation, and Field Maps for data collection and location 
            tracking. Explore the rest of this website to learn more about the Web8 team and the process to fulfill our proposal.
