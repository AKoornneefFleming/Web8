            <p class = "p1">This is content created with Bob Ross Ipsum. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. And just raise cain. You can do anything your heart can imagine. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.
                We'll do another happy little painting. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
                If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Poor old tree. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
                You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Work that paint.
                This painting comes right out of your heart. There are no limits in this world. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
                In your world you have total and absolute power. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. A fan brush can be your best friend.
                In this world, everything can be happy. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. At home you have unlimited time. See there how easy that is. We can fix anything.
