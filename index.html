            <p class = "p1">Fleming College is a college based out of Ontario. It was founded in Peterborough, Ontario in 1967 by Sir Sanford Fleming. Sir Sanford Fleming was an engineer and innovator with many life accomplishments. He was the first to survey and draw plans for the Pacific-Atlantic rail line, he invented the Universal Standard Time, he designed Canada’s first postage stamp, he was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Institute, and many more. Today, the college has campuses in Peterborough (Sutherland Campus), Lindsay (Frost Campus),  and Haliburt (Haliburton Campus). Fleming college has over one-hundred programs and is most known for its excellence in environmental, natural, and social sciences.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <h3>Ideal: </h2>
            <p class = "p1"> Visitors to a college campus should be able to navigate from one room to another using a web based solution. 
                Additionally, the school is interested in the capability of having staff collecting data, and tracking staff location.
            </p>
            <h3>Reality: </h2>
            <p class = "p1"> It is unknown what technology is available to navigate on a room-to-room level, collect data, or track staff. No solution is currently in place 
            </p>
            <h3>Consequences: </h2> 
            <p class = "p1"> Some technologies require extensive licenses, or may not be suited to this solution, keeping 
                campus navigation difficult. Sharing updates on locations without spatial data leads to complications and misunderstanding.  
                Additionally, not knowing the location of staff can complicate emergencies.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposal: </h2>
            <p class = "p1"> Investigate appropriate GIS solutions that will allow for public navigation of the campus (indoor wayfinding), data collection, 
                and tracking for specific user types,using a mobile phone. An evaluation of advantages and disadvantages for relevant technology will be presented 
                as well as a rapid prototype implemented for the ideal solution.

            <p class = "p1"> Every time you practice, you learn more. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.
            Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.
            Just let these leaves jump off the brush We'll make some happy little bushes here. Here's something that's fun. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.
