            <p class = "p1">PUT YOUR SUMMARY HERE. This is content created with Bob Ross Ipsum. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. And just raise cain. You can do anything your heart can imagine. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.
                We'll do another happy little painting. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
                If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Poor old tree. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
                You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Work that paint.
                This painting comes right out of your heart. There are no limits in this world. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
                In your world you have total and absolute power. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. A fan brush can be your best friend.
                In this world, everything can be happy. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. At home you have unlimited time. See there how easy that is. We can fix anything.

            <p class = "p1"> This web solution is a visually appealing solution for effectively displaying results.</p>
            <li> The main advantage of using StoryMaps is that the interface is very user-friendly.</li>
            <li> There are many different options for displaying information, which are easy to integrate. Such as still images, slideshows, map tours, 2D and 3D interactive maps</li>
            <li> It is also possible to embed 360 images, which help users explore different rooms on campus.</li>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> StoryMaps overall is a great web map solution. Although there are some limitations.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li> The main dissadvantage is that is it not great for navigation. Since it is more a solution to display results, there is location awareness or routing available</li>
            <li> The interactivity with maps is limited. Users cannot turn on/ off layers when interacting with an embeded map. If you want to show things in categories so the map is not overwhelming, the layers that will be viewable need to be set before embeding the map. For example, if you wanted users to explore the first and second floors of a building seperately, you would need to display each floor on its map as users cannot change between them on the same map.</li>
            <li> If using slideshows, once the StoryMap is downloaded in PDF format, the slideshow formatting does not transfer.</li>
            <li> Users must be connected to internet to access the StoryMap.</li>
        </ul>
