            <h2>Using JavaScript libraries and developer products to create a lightweight, customizable web-tier</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> Using Leaflet and ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript to create a lightweight, customizable web-tier has several advantages for the Web8 team and our client.  
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> First, it provides a highly flexible and customizable approach to developing a solution, that can scale to our clientâ€™s desired complexity and budget. 
                It also allows our client to host the solution directly on their existing website server, making it easier for potential users to organically
                find the navigation solution without the need to download any additional applications, or navigate to third-party sites.
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> Solutions can integrate a wide range of spatial data types from different sources, including existing data within the client's ArcGIS Online (AGOL) 
                or ArcGIS Enterprise account, lightweight GeoJSON files, and/or in the case of Leaflet, open source data such as Open Street Maps, hosted in various locations. This makes amalgamating 
                spatial data inside and outside of ArcGIS Online possible and can also lead to lightweight and speedy infrastructure, providing flexibility and the ability to scale 
                solutions to meet client budgets.
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> However, there are costs associated with using these solutions. Using them requires an in-house web development team for our client to maintain, 
                potentially necessitating collaboration outside of the GIS department. It also increases the length of time required to develop a high-quality solution. In the case of 
                ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, Esri licensing is also required.

            <h2>What Worked Well</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> For this project, the Web8 development team experimented with both the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript (ArcGIS licensing required) 
                as well as the open-source JavaScript library Leaflet (open source). ArcGIS is a developer product for building mapping and spatial analysis applications for the web.
                Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Both solutions were tested and implemented by hosting webpages in GitHub, and using 
                the JavaScript to create the required functionality and call in the required resources. 
                To follow along with the development process, we have made the demo pages and the GitHub repository they are hosted in available, so you can follow along with 
                the code and resulting visualization.

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> There were a few key lessons learned along the way that should be considered when selecting these JavaScript library solutions for future projects:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>If the client is working specifically with an AGOL infrastructure, with possibly some GeoJSON files as well, ArcGIS JavaScript is a reasonable approach. 
                However, introducing non-Esri middle tier and data tier makes Leaflet a better potential option.</li>
            <li>Creating websites rather than implementing a no-code approach such as ArcGIS Story Maps or ArcGIS Experience Builder, requires patience and/or experience and may not be suitable for projects with short turnaround, high quality requirements. 
                It also requires the client to have their own server and domain to host the web page, and a web team to integrate and maintain it. </li>
            <li>A challenge associated with using GeoJSON files is that it appears to require stylizing the symbology in the code itself, adding to the complexity of the solution.</li>
            <li>There were a few bugs experienced using API keys with ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript v4.25 to display AGOL content. This necessitated working 
                backwards and using v4.24 until v4.26 was released. </li>
            <li>On several occasions, the hosted webpages were flagged as security concerns by browsers during testing. This highlights the importance of sufficient 
                knowledge about internet security practices before creating and hosting websites for public viewing.</li>
        </ul>
