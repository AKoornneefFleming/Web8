            <p class = "p1">PUT YOUR SUMMARY HERE. This is content created with Bob Ross Ipsum. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. And just raise cain. You can do anything your heart can imagine. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.
                We'll do another happy little painting. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
                If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Poor old tree. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
                You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Work that paint.
                This painting comes right out of your heart. There are no limits in this world. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
                In your world you have total and absolute power. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. A fan brush can be your best friend.
                In this world, everything can be happy. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. At home you have unlimited time. See there how easy that is. We can fix anything.

        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> Experience Builder is a great Public-Facing web-solution.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>    
            <li> Overall this web solution produces a nice interface, which can be heavily customized as there are many widgets available.</li>
            <li> You can add 2D or 3D maps.</li>
            <li> It is possible to have multiple pages to show different maps or different sections of a map.</li>
            <li> It works well on desktop view as well as mobile view.</li>
            <li> It does have a navigation component, which uses geocoded addresses. This is useful for getting directions from one location to another.</li>
            <li> You can add images, charts, a legend, etc.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> The biggest challenge with Experience Builder is that it takes more time than other web-solutions to fully understand how to create a quality web experience.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>    
            <li> Although it has a navigation section, it is not great for indoor navigation.</li>
            <li> There is a widget to get precise coordinates by clicking on the map, which users can copy/ paste these coordinates into the navigation section. This could be a work-around for choosing a precise location in the navigation (like a room or location within a building), without relying solely on geocoded addresses, but this is not very user-friendly.</li>
            <li> After publishing the experience builder for the public, each route request uses credits.</li>
            <li> You can add a Filter Widget to search for specific attributes within your layers, for example, room numbers, buildings, or fire hydrants. However, more experimentation with this is necessary.</li>
