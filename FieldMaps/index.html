            <h2>Using Field Maps to configure web-based solutions</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> ArcGIS Field Maps configurable solutions has undeniable alignment with the Web8 teams’ proposal and the clients’ problems. Solutions are easily customized and configured to the clients needs, allowing the application to be used in several different use cases. Field Maps can easily be used as a navigation, location tracking, and data collection application. 
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> First and foremost, Field Maps is intended for use as a data collection application. It allows workers to collect data in the field on their mobile device and upload information to a shared database. The Web8 team took advantage of this, by using Field Maps to solve the clients need for data collection around the campus. A hosted feature layer with editing and syncing properties enabled was brought into an AGOL map for further configuration in Field Maps web designer. This allowed forms to be created for data collection and entry into the hosted feature layer. With the mobile Field Maps app, the user can collect and enter the features data effortlessly. 
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> Next, the Web8 team used the software to create a navigation solution. Field Maps can help users find features and show asset information. By creating a map with the necessary features in ArcGIS Pro and exporting the map as a mobile map package on AGOL, users can then view and interact with the map in the mobile application. Users can view their location and navigate towards their desired location in a fully customized map.  
            </p>
            <p class = "p1"> Finally, Field Maps was used by the Web8 team to create a location tracking application for the client. ArcGIS Track Viewer can be used to set up a Track View, for specific users, which can then be shown in the Field Maps application. The AGOL administration sets up the tack view, ensures the users location tracking settings are enabled, and specifies users to be tracked and to be able to see others tracks. Once the track view layer is configured in an AGOL map, users with access to the layer can then view the map in the Field Maps mobile application. The way we configured the solution, the last known location of the specified users are visible within the map.

        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> The Web8 development team experimented with several different use case solutions using Field Maps. Essentially the software worked well in a variety of ways to solve the clients’ problems.

                <li>Users can collect data in the field and upload their data to the hosted feature layer in a few simple steps  </li>
                <li>Editing and synching capabilities can be enabled for specific features within a configured map </li>
                        <li>Add, delete and update capabilities can individually be allowed </li>
                <li>Editing can be tracked, and can be allowed publicly or only within the organization  </li>
                <li>Forms can be configured to each feature, based on the features fields </li>
                        <li>Fields can be required, calculated based on other fields, shown or hidden, have default values, etc.  </li>
                        <li>Domains, set up for the feature in ArcGIS Pro, can be configured as selectable options for that field  </li>

                <li>The application shows the users real time location </li>
                <li>User’s can not only see the map, but can search and select features  </li>
                        <li>To ensure this capability, choose a display field for the feature in ArcGIS Pro that will correspond with each records title </li>
                <li>Uploading the desired map as a mobile map package to AGOL allows the map to be downloadable, by users, for offline use</li>
                        <li>Using a mobile map package is ideal for navigation purposes, as it won’t give users editing capabilities </li>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p class = "p1"> Although the capabilities of Field Maps truthfully exceeded our expectations, there were major downfalls that kept this solution from superseding the others. The biggest consequence of Field Maps is that the user needs to download the Field Map app on their phone in order to use the solution. Other issues and mishaps with this solution were due to time constraints and include the following: </p>

            <p class = "p1">Specific to Data Collection Solution </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculation conundrums </li>
                    <li>Expressions for automatically populating field values can only be written in arcade, which took the team a bit of time to adjust to  </li>
                    <li>Ideally, a field for the date of data collection could be automatically populated with the current days date. Unfortunately, the arcade expression for retrieving the date value did not work as it should have, and is a problem amongst many Field Maps users. If more time was allotted, the team would look further into this issue for resolve. </li>
        </ul>
         
        <div class = "text">

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Basemap bummers  </li>
                    <li>Esri basemaps should be compatible with mobile map packages, but ultimately would not show up on the mobile application </li>
                    <li>Our final solution opted to use a custom basemap created by the team, uploaded as feature layers   </li>
                    <li>Ideally the basemap should not be shown as an operational layer, and with more time we would have added it to the map as a true basemap or raster layer   </li>
            <li>Searchability suffering   </li>
                    <li>Features should be searchable using the search widget in the mobile app, however records within the feature layer were not in our final solution    </li>
                    <li>Ideally the user should be able to search for specific features via the records display name, and with more time the team would certainly fix this dilemma    </li>
        </ul>

            <p class = "p1">Specific to Location Tracking Solution </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Administrator ambiguity  </li>
                    <li>Because the track view layer has to be set up by an administrator and is owned by them, several issues arise   </li>
                    <li>The administrator is responsible for setting up the track view layer and enabling user settings   </li>
                    <li>As a non-owner, filters cannot be employed to the layer on AGOL maps, and a temporal filter is recommended to avoid showing old data   </li>
                    <li>As a non-owner, the layers refresh interval can’t be changed in AGOL, and there is no way to check what it’s set to. For best practice, it’s recommended that last known location is set to refresh every 30 seconds.   </li>
            <li>Symbology sadness   </li>
                    <li>Originally the symbology for each users location was a dot with their initials. After using the application a couple of times, all of the users symbols were the same, using one users initials. If more time was allotted, the team would further investigate this issue.  </li>
                    <li>Problems like this may be expected, as ArcGIS Tracker is technically deprecated.   </li>
